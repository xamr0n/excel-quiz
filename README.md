5 Random Questions from Microsoft Excel

The purpose of this app is to provide a simple and interactive way to test my knowledge of Microsoft Excel, and to learn more about the program through a series of random, multiple-choice questions I found from the web.

The app randomly selects five from the list of questions and displays them one at a time, along with their four possible answer choices. When select an answer and click the Submit button, the app checks to see if the answer is correct and displays the next question. Once all five questions have been answered, the app calculates and displays my final score.
